Remove the pan from the heat and whisk the mixture until smooth, glossy and thickened. Set aside to cool for 1–2 hours, or until thick enough to spread over the cake. <br>\n<br>\nStep 7: To assemble the cake, run a round-bladed knife around the inside of the cake tins to loosen the cakes.

Drain thoroughly and put into a large saucepan that has a lid. Pour over 1 pint of water. Bring to the boil and allow to simmer for about 25 minutes or until nearly all the water has been absorbed. Remove from the heat, cover with a lid and allow to stand for 10 minutes. <br>\n<br>\nStep 2: Then tip the rice onto a large flat clean tray. A metallic is probably best as it will help the rice cool down quicker. Dress the rice with the mirin, turning frequently as this helps the rice to cool. Then fan with a fan or a magazine until the rice is room temperature (not essential but quite authentic). <br>\n<br>\nStep 3: To make the sushi take a Japanese bamboo sushi mat and place a sheet of seaweed on top. Have a small bowl of water to hand. Dip your fingers in the water before you touch the rice. Spread the rice over three quarters of the seaweed, take a little rice at a time and push it to the edges leaving a layer about ½ cm thick. Leave the quarter the furthest away from you plain. <br>\n<br>\nStep 4: Next smear a little wasabi in a line a little off center nearest to your body. Follow with a layer of tuna, a spring onion, and a piece of cucumber. Roll up the bamboo mat slowly, tucking in the closer end of the sushi roll to start a roll and press lightly with both hands. Remove the roll from the mat and leave to sit with the joining edges downwards. You can wrap in cling film and keep in a cool place until you are ready to serve. Do not place in the fridge as this dries out the rice. <br>\n<br>\nStep 5: To serve, using a lightly moistened sharp knife to trim the ends, then cut into 6-8 pieces.

Feel free to use a mix of mushrooms depending on what is available. Wild mushrooms have a more distinctive flavour, but cultivated chestnut or portobello mushrooms are still very good.','Vegetarian','Main Course','Italy',45,'Intermediate','Step 1: Add the chicken (or vegetable) stock and dried mushrooms to a large pan and bring to a simmer. <br>\n<br>\nStep 2: To prepare the mixed mushrooms, finely chop any cultivated mushrooms (such as chestnut or portobello), and tear any wild mushrooms into small pieces to keep an interesting shape and mix of textures. <br>\n<br>\nStep 3: Melt a third of the butter in a frying pan over a medium–high heat. Fry the mushrooms with the garlic until they are golden brown and any watery juices have evaporated. Transfer to a plate and set aside. <br>\n<br>\nStep 4: Heat the olive oil in a large pan over a medium heat. Gently fry the shallot until softened, but not browned. Add the rice, stir to coat in the oil and cook for 3 minutes. Add the wine to the pan and cook until absorbed completely. <br>\n<br>\nStep 5: Start adding the hot stock, one ladle at a time (if you don’t have a ladle, you could use a mug), allowing each ladle to be almost completely absorbed before adding the next. Stir the risotto regularly to prevent it from sticking and to help it cook evenly. <br>\n<br>\nStep 6: When the rice is creamy but retains a little bite, turn off the heat and stir in the remaining butter and Parmesan and cover with a tea towel for 1 minute. The risotto should have a flowing texture, not stodgy and stiff. <br>\n<br>\nStep 7: Add the cooked mushrooms and the dried mushrooms from the stock to the pan. Stir, adding a little more stock as needed to loosen to a slow-flowing consistency. Taste and season with salt and black pepper. <br>\n<br>\nStep 8: Serve finished with chopped parsley and extra grated Parmesan.',_binary 'media/meal/Mushroom_Risotto.jpg',3,'½ tbsp olive oil<br>75g/2½ oz pancetta, chopped<br>200g/7oz dried spaghetti<br>2 large free-range eggs<br>100g/3½oz Parmesan, grated, plus extra for serving<br>1 tbsp full-fat milk<br>salt and freshly ground pepper<br>'),(6,'Guacamole','Check out the easy, authentic guacamole that the Hairy Bikers brought back from their Mexican travels.

(You can do this the night before or in the morning, if necessary). Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large frying pan over a medium–high heat and fry the meat in two batches, using the remaining oil to fry the second batch. When the chunks are sealed and browned all over, place in a bowl and sprinkle over the flour. Stir through until the dustiness has disappeared.

Layer in the onion, garlic, and steak, adding any remaining flour or juices from the bowl. Add the stock cubes, mustard, and Worcestershire sauce and season with some black pepper.

Pour all over the steak mixture, add the lid and cook on low for 7–8 hours until the meat is tender. <br>\n<br>\nStep 4: Heat the butter in a frying pan over a high heat and fry the mushrooms until softened and golden.
